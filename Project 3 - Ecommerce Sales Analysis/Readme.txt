**E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard Project**  

1. **Project Initiation & Objective Definition**  
   - Identified the goal: Analyze an e-commerce dataset to uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and regional performance.  
   - Selected Power BI and DAX as primary tools for analysis and visualization.  

2. **Data Acquisition & Preparation**  
   - Sourced the dataset from Kaggle (9,994 rows, spanning January 2014 to January 2017).  
   - Cleaned and transformed the data in Power BI (e.g., handled missing values, standardized formats).  

3. **Data Modeling & DAX Calculations**  
   - Built relationships between tables (e.g., orders, customers, products).  
   - Created calculated measures using DAX (e.g., Total Sales, Profit Margins, Customer Lifetime Value).  

4. **Dashboard Design & Visualization**  
   - Developed an interactive dashboard with KPIs (Total Sales: $2.3M, Profit: $286K, 7,930 Customers).  
   - Added visualizations like maps (regional performance), bar charts (top sub-categories: Phones/Chairs), and tables (top customers).  

5. **Key Insights Generation**  
   - Highlighted top-performing regions (West: $725K sales) and underperforming cities (Philadelphia, San Francisco).  
   - Analyzed shipping delaysâ€™ impact (4+ day delays still drove revenue).  

6. **Documentation & Presentation**  
   - Summarized findings in a report (e.g., trends, actionable recommendations).  
   - Included lessons learned (DAX, data modeling, dashboard UX).  

7. **Final Deliverable & Sharing**  
   - Published the dashboard for stakeholder access.  
   - Shared the project on LinkedIn to showcase analytical and Power BI skills.  

**Outcome:** A data-driven tool to optimize sales strategies, customer targeting, and operational efficiency for e-commerce businesses.
