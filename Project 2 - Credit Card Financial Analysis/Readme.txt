**Credit Card Financial Weekly Dashboard Project**  

1. **Project Scope & Objective**  
   - Defined the goal: Monitor and analyze weekly credit card financial metrics (e.g., transactions, fraud alerts, payments).  
   - Targeted stakeholders: Finance teams, risk analysts, and operational managers.  

2. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Integrated raw data from credit card transaction logs, payment systems, and fraud detection tools.  
   - Cleaned data by handling missing values, standardizing date formats, and removing duplicates.  

3. **Data Modeling & Metrics Calculation**  
   - Built relationships between tables (e.g., transactions ↔ customers ↔ payment status).  
   - Created DAX measures for KPIs: Weekly spend volume, payment delays, fraud rates, and approval ratios.  

4. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with:  
     - **Key Metrics**: Total transactions, average payment time, fraud incidents.  
     - **Visuals**: Trend lines (weekly spend), heatmaps (fraud hotspots), and tables (top declined transactions).  
   - Added filters for drill-down (e.g., by card type, region).  

5. **Insights & Anomaly Detection**  
   - Identified patterns: Spike in fraud on weekends, delayed payments in specific regions.  
   - Flagged outliers (e.g., unusually high declines for premium cardholders).  

6. **Automation & Deployment**  
   - Scheduled weekly data refreshes to keep the dashboard updated.  
   - Shared access with stakeholders via Power BI Service for real-time monitoring.  

7. **Documentation & Use Case**  
   - Summarized findings in a 1-pager for executive reviews.  
   - Highlighted actionable steps (e.g., enhance weekend fraud checks, optimize payment reminders).  

**Outcome**: A real-time monitoring tool to reduce financial risks, improve approval rates, and streamline credit card operations.
